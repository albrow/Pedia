Pedia is a simple command line tool (for bash) for querying wikipedia. The results appear directly in terminal.
Portions of the underlying code are based on: http://baldwinsoftware.com/blog/2011/04/25/search-google-wikipedia-reservo-from-the-bash-terminal/

Usage is trivially easy:

    pedia <search term>

Multiple arguments will be treated a single term.

Enjoy!
